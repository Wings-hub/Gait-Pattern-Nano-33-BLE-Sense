Introduction:

Walking is the major movement for a human locomotion. The challanges during this locomotion can be caused by instability, disorder or incoordination. If human face such
challanges it can cost a lot more energy to perform due to the anormalies. It also overloads the muscles and can cause damage to joint structures and skin. To analyze 
movements and identify it as walking an andruino Nano chip is suitable. If right positioned it detects and measures right kinematic parameters such as angle, angular 
velocity and accelation. Joints like knee, hip and ankles will be generating a 3D kinematic model so that the gait can be analyzed.

Gait analysis:

Human gait analysis is an important topic in pedestrian navigation and elderly care. Identifying gait phases is important for using human gait for pedestrian navigation
and tracking. Most of the existing gait phase detection methods use multiple sensor modules attached to each section of the lower body. In this paper, the feasibility 
of detecting gait phases with a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) in the subject's pocket is discussed. The motion of the thigh is calculated by fusing 
accelerometer and gyroscopic data from the IMU. The experimental results show that most of the most important gait phases, e.g. For example, initial contact, stress 
response, mean stance, final stance, forward swing, and swing can be identified from movement of a thigh sensed by an IMU. It was also found that offside leg motion 
can also be estimated from the fused IMU data. In this paper, a method is presented that can be used to detect all the important phases of the human gait cycle when 
walking based on the movement of a thigh.
