@article{PERRING:2020,
	abstract = {Objective
Quantitative gait analysis has been established as a valuable tool for functional assessment and evaluation of intervention efficacy in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). We aimed to bolster the limited evidence on the specific aspects of gait that are altered in LSS.
Methods
Fifteen patients with LSS and 15 healthy subjects performed a 30-m-long walk. Gait was assessed by video recording. Four spatiotemporal parameters were compared between groups: cadence, gait velocity, step length, and step duration.
Results
Compared with healthy subjects, gait of patients with LSS demonstrated significant differences for all spatiotemporal parameters. Differences in mean cadence, step length, gait velocity, and step duration were −14%, −24%, −37%, and +16% between patients with LSS and healthy subjects.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated significant alterations in clinically measurable gait parameters in patients with LSS compared with healthy subjects. Future studies should assess the value of these gait parameters for objective clinical assessment of functional status and intervention efficacy through correlation with currently used subjective tools and comparison at preoperative and postoperative time points. Specific gait alterations identified in patients with LSS may be valuable for clinical objective assessment of functional status and intervention efficacy.},
